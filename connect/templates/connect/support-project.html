                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>We aim to raise funds for solar panel installations on various community buildings to promote sustainable energy usage.</p>
                
                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Install solar panels on at least 10 community buildings within the next year.</li>
                    <li>Reduce community energy costs by 30% through solar energy adoption.</li>
                    <li>Educate the community about renewable energy and its benefits.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Impact on the Community</h3>
                <p>This initiative will not only help in reducing the carbon footprint but will also empower local residents by providing them with a more sustainable energy source. The savings generated from reduced energy costs can be redirected towards community programs and initiatives.</p>

                <h3>Funding Usage</h3>
                <p>The funds raised will be used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purchasing and installing solar panels.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance of the solar systems.</li>
                    <li>Community workshops and educational materials on solar energy.</li>
                </ul>
